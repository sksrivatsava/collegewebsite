                    In order to meet the wide ranging, challenging and very rapidly growing Global Demands for “Professional Electronics and Communication Engineers” in this Hi-Tech Era, the Department of “Electronics and Communication Engineering” was established .

                    The Objective of the Institution is to impart “Quality Engineering Education” and promote the growth of effective, efficient and true Professionals, through adherence of the highest Standards of Academic Integrity and overall Ethical conduct, to develop a sense of Individual Responsibility and also to collectively Participate in reinforcing and maintaining an Environment of Honor, Trust and Standards.
                    
                    The Department strives to develop long Term relationships with Industries and market the Student’s Talents effectively. The Students are thus provided high level ‘Leads and Pathways’ that enable them to gain access to a broad range of ‘high potential’ and ‘hi-tech’ Career Opportunities.
